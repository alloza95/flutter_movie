# Flutter Movies (TMDB)

Personal project to practice. A Flutter app about movies and tv shows.  You can see the most popular, upcomings and top rated movies/shows and a "Detail Screen" for each. Data was fetched from TMDB API.

## Main Screen

Main screen is the movie section. You can see the most popular, upcoming and top rated movies through a Bottom Navigation. You can change to tv shows section through an options menu.
